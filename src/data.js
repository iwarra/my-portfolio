export const aboutMe = "I'm a Frontend Web Developer with background in communications and coordinating. The initial spark that ignited my interest in front-end was playing with my now ten years old blog. Around a year ago I decided to take the jump and switch career path. I enjoy building things and love to combine functionality with design. In my free time I enjoy learning new things, reading books and petting dogs. I'm open to job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and grow. If you know of an opportunity that matches my skills please don't hesitate to contact me."
