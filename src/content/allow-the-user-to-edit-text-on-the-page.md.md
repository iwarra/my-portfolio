summary: Simple HTML attribute that allows the user to edit the text
---

Using the 'contenteditable' attribute indicates if the given element should be editable by the user. We can assign it a boolean value, an empty string which equals to true or 'plaintext-only' to indicate that the raw text is editable, but not the rich text formatting.

```html
<p contenteditable="true"></p>
```
