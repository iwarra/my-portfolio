summary: Add a custom mail to your domain for free with Zoho mail.

When you buy a domain you are often offered to pay extra to get email hosting with it. Those can work great especially for bigger companies with more accounts. However, there are services out there that provide custom e-mail hosting for free.

Zoho Mail is one of them and is pretty simple to set up. You sign up here:
https://mail.zoho.com/signup?type=org&plan=free

Then you have to edit your DNS-records (you can access those at your domain provider's page). Zoho has a pretty detailed guide on their page on how to do that and it's more or less down to copying some lines and adding them to your DNS records. It also allows up to five users in its free plan, allowing you to have name@, info@, order@ and similar, based on your needs.

Your e-mail can be accessed via the browser (https://mail.zoho.eu) or by their Zoho Mail-app.
