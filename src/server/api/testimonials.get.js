				"I was introduced to Ivona through the Pollination mentorship program at Beela during the spring of 2023. As her mentor, I was very proud to see Ivona's determination. Ivona is an excellent communicator and an active listener. During our meetings, she always arrived prepared with an agenda and an action plan to achieve her goals. Ivona took the initiative to lead each of our meetings with clarity and confidence. She demonstrated her interest and commitment through her strong work ethic. In my opinion, adaptability and having an open mind are crucial skills to have in today's rapidly changing technology landscape. Ivona has been very mindful of this from the beginning of her career transition, learning new skills and adapting new technologies to be prepared for any challenges. While I believe Ivona will continue to build her technical expertise, adding new skills to her CV, the soft skills she already has are what sets her apart.
