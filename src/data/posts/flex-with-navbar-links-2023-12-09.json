  "body": "Flex is very helpful when positioning links in the navbar. The thing I use over and over again when creating simple headers is the flex display for all the elements in the header (and these are usually the logo and the navigation links). I want to separate those and give each their own place to shine. Thatâ€™s where justify-content: space-between does the trick. You can use justify/align with different space options (check this cheatsheet to see more) that allow you to distance the element. The space-between puts the first element at the start and the last one at the end which is what I want with the logo and the links occupying the header."
